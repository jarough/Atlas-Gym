        <p class="text-center">If you are a new gym member or even a long-time member, our experienced personal trainers
            can always help you take your workout to the next step. They can assist in creating safe and effective
            regimes
            designed to each individual as well as offering support and motivation throughout the program.
            <br><br>
            Benefits to having a personal trainer are that you get to learn correct workout form to prevent injury, gain
            more knowledge about which routines benefit you the most, and they can help set goals both short and long term.
            <br><br>
            Interested in taking on a personal trainer? Please enquire at reception.
